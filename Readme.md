# Watermarking PDF Files

This script uses the PyPDF2 library in Python to watermark PDF files. It allows you to add a watermark from a separate PDF file to each page of the target PDF file.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python installed on your system. Additionally, you need to install the PyPDF2 library. 
You can install it using pip: pip install PyPDF2

## Usage

1. Place the script in the same directory as the PDF file you want to watermark. If the target PDF file has a different name, replace 'Sample.pdf' in the script with the actual filename.

2. If your watermark is in a separate PDF file, place it in the same directory as the script. Replace 'Watermark.pdf' in the script with the actual filename of your watermark PDF.

3. Run the script. It will generate an output PDF file with the watermark added to each page. You can change the output filename by modifying the 'Watermarked Output.pdf' value in the script.

4. Once the script finishes running, you will find the watermarked output PDF file in the same directory.

## Note

1. Make sure the PyPDF2 library is compatible with your version of Python. If you encounter any errors, try installing a compatible version of the library.

2. Ensure that the target PDF file and watermark PDF file are valid and accessible in the specified locations.

                     That's it! You can now use this script to watermark your PDF files easily.
